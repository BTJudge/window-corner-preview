## What's new?
Here's a list of most changes for each version

### v. 4
 - Hide and seek behavior auto shows / hides based on passive action from user
 - Corner Entry on Indicator
 - Reset Crop on Indicator
 #### BREAKING CHANGE:
  - SHIFT + CLICK: active the mirrored window (< v.4 it was CTRL + CLICK instead)
  > Reason: shift was already a special key preventing the preview from getting transparent, it makes sense to stick to the same mask

### v. 3
 - Fix to run on 3.30+
 - Zoom, corner and cropping global persistency
 - Auto reload last window after stand-by / reboot (use some approximation, 90% affidability)

### v. 2

 - Supports preview cropping
 - Scroll events handling
 - Improved tweening settings for a more natural GNOME look
 - Autohide when windows are not supposed to be displayed
 - Schema settings added
 - Can optionally hide itself when the mirrored window is focused on top

### v. 1

  - Forked and adapted
